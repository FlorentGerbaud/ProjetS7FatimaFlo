	\subsection{Useful Definition}
		\textbf{\underline{Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE):}} \newline\newline
		An ODE is a mathematical equation that relates a function to its derivatives with respect to one or more independent variables. ODEs are commonly represented given a function F of x, y, and derivatives of y. Then, an equation of the form
		\begin{align*}
			F\left(x,y,y',\ldots ,y^{(n-1)}\right)=y^{(n)}
		\end{align*}
		
		\textbf{\underline{SMRT}} \newline\newline
		SMRT means Simple road traffic simulation
	
	\subsection{Simple Road Traffic Modeling}
	
		Road traffic modeling involves studying how vehicles behave on road networks, with the aim of simulating and analyzing aspects such as traffic flow, congestion, and driver behavior. This field employs mathematical and computer models to understand and predict traffic patterns, playing a crucial role in urban planning, traffic management, and the development of intelligent transportation systems (as shown in Figure \ref{fig:intro}). 
		
		Explore the integration of a driving simulator with a traffic simulator in Jeihani et al.'s study \cite{JEIHANI2017164}, revealing enhanced traffic density and Variable Message Sign (VMS) reliability. The findings suggest that integration positively influences compliance behavior and factors affecting route diversion.

		\subsubsection{The Objective of SMRT}
		The primary goal of simple road simulation is to analyze and understand vehicle behavior in a controlled and reproducible environment. Researchers and engineers use these simulations to study the impact of various factors on traffic flow, safety, and efficiency. This contributes to the development and testing of traffic management strategies and vehicle control systems, providing insights into the dynamic interactions between vehicles and the road environment.
		
		\subsubsection{Use Case to Explain the Interest of These Simulations}
		Simple road simulations find applications in various fields, including urban planning, transportation engineering, and autonomous vehicle development. For instance, they can assess the effectiveness of new traffic signal timings, study the implications of road design changes, or test the performance of autonomous vehicles in different traffic scenarios. These simulations offer a cost-effective and risk-free way to evaluate real-world interventions and innovations, enhancing decision-making processes and supporting the development of sustainable and efficient transportation systems.
		
		\subsubsection{Field of Application}
		Simple road simulation is applied across a wide range of fields, including transportation research, traffic engineering, and urban planning. It plays a crucial role in the development and validation of autonomous vehicle technologies. The ability to model and simulate various road conditions helps researchers and practitioners make informed decisions, improving the design and management of transportation systems. Simple road simulation serves as a powerful tool for enhancing our understanding of traffic dynamics and contributes to the ongoing evolution of smart and adaptive transportation systems.
		
	
	\subsubsection{Using GitHub for Project Management}

	\section{Project Objectives}
	In this modeling, we will focus on the position and velocity of multiple vehicles following each other in a single lane. We will assume that vehicles accelerate when they have open space, do nothing when they are close to the vehicle in front, and brake more strongly as they get very close. We will arrange two and then three vehicles, one behind the other, with the first vehicle maintaining a constant velocity, and observe the behavior of the following vehicles.\newline
	So, the main objectives of the project are: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Modeling the behavior using coupled ordinary differential equations.
		\item Implementing this simplistic modeling.
		\item Studying the outcomes based on different parameters.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Problems Encountered}
	
	\section{The equation for SMRT}
		\subsection{Differential Ordinary Equation }
		In this part, the idea is to resolve two types of systems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) that allow us to simulate traffic flow. To achieve this, we will use the Euler Explicit method to numerically solve the solutions.
		The Euler Explicit method is given by the folowing eqution :
		\begin{itemize}
			\item EDO to solve: $\boxed{y'(t) = f{\bigl (}t, y(t){\bigr )}}$.
			\item First step of the resolution: $\boxed{y_0 = y(t_0)}$.
			\item Recursive process to find the n-th solution of the EDO: $\boxed{y_{n+1} = y_{n} + hf(t_{n}, y_{n})}$
		\end{itemize}
		
		
		
		
		
		\subsubsection{Linear Model}
			\textbf{\underline{Mathematical Theory:}}
			\newline
			
			In this section, we're going to explain the math behind our model for understanding how cars behave in traffic. To make things simple, we use a discrete model, which means we look at cars one at a time and how they interact on the road.
			
			Each car's movement is governed by a basic equation:
			
			\begin{align*}
				\dot{x_i}(t) = V_i = \alpha_i(x_{i-1} - x_i)
			\end{align*}
			
			In this equation, \(x_i(t)\) represents where the \(i\)-th car is at a given time, \(V_i\) is how fast the \(i\)-th car is going, and \(\alpha_i\) is a number that describes how that car behaves. The right side of the equation, \(\alpha_i(x_{i-1} - x_i)\), tells us how the car's speed changes based on how close it is to the car in front.
			
			When we put this equation to work for all the cars, we end up with a bunch of equations (one for each car), which helps us understand how they all move together in traffic. These equations give us a dynamic view of how cars influence each other as they drive.
			
			The system of equations is written like this for each car, where \(i\) can be 1, 2, and so on, up to the number of cars:
			
			\begin{align*}
				\left\{
				\begin{array}{ll}
					\dot{x}_1 &= V_1 \\
					\dot{x}_2(t) &= \alpha_2(x_1 - x_2) \\
					&\vdots \\
					\dot{x}_n(t) &= \alpha_n(x_{n-1} - x_n)
				\end{array}
				\right.
			\end{align*}
			
			These equations help us understand how traffic flows and how individual cars influence one another on the road.
			
			In the first part of the study, we consider $\alpha_i$ as a constant. However, in the next part of the simulation, we define some functions $\alpha_i(t)$.
			
			In fact, we have three types of simulations:
			
			1. \textbf{\underline{Constant value:}}
			\[
			\alpha_i(t) = C_i
			\]
			
			2. \textbf{\underline{Sinusoidal with noise:}}
			\[
			\alpha_i(t) = \left| W \cdot \sin(\omega t + \phi) + \mathcal{N}(0, 0.1) \right|
			\]
			
			3. \textbf{\underline{Stochastic Driver Model:}} \newline \newline
			Consider a random driver model with an output labeled as \( \alpha_i(t) \), which relies on various factors like the average, spread, and time \( t \). This model produces a random noise part from a usual distribution with an average and spread of \( \sqrt{\text{spread}} \). If a limit is given, the generated noise is confined within the interval \([- \text{limit}, \text{limit}]\). \newline \newline
			
			\textbf{Mathematically, we can express this as:}
		
			
			\[
			\alpha_i(t) =
			\begin{cases}
				\left| \mathcal{N}(\text{average}, \sqrt{\text{spread}}) \right|, & \text{if } -\text{limit} \leq \alpha_i(t) \leq \text{limit}, \\
				-\text{limit}, & \text{if } \alpha_i(t) < -\text{limit}, \\
				\text{limit}, & \text{if } \alpha_i(t) > \text{limit}.
			\end{cases}
			\]
			
			Here, \( \text{average} \) signifies the mean of the acceleration, and \( \text{spread} \) stands for the acceleration's spread. The limit is defined to prevent or create specific situations, like accidents, depending on the desired result. \\

		\subsubsection{Newell's Model}
		\textbf{\underline{Mathematical Theory:}}
		In this section, we model the velocity using an exponential model, so the movement of each car is given by:
		\begin{align*}
			\dot{x_i}(t) =V_i(1-e^{-\frac{\lambda_i}{V_i}(x_{i-1}(t) - x_i(t) - d_i})
		\end{align*} 
		$V_i$, $\lambda_i$, $d_i$ parameters associated with the ith car:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $V_i$ : the maximum velocity of the ith car.
			\item $\lambda_i$ : the capacity of acceleration/decelaration.
			\item $d_i$ : the minimum headway(safe following distance). 
		\end{itemize}
		By using this equation for each car, we get a bunch of equations—one for each car. This helps us grasp how they all move together in traffic. These equations give us a dynamic picture of how cars affect each other as they drive.\newline
		
		The set of equations is written like this for each car, where $i$ can be 1, 2, and so on, up to the total number of cars:
		\begin{align*}
			\left\{
			\begin{array}{ll}
				\dot{x}_1 &= V_1 \\
				\dot{x}_2(t) &= V_2(1-e^{-\frac{\lambda_2}{V_2}(x_{1}(t) - x_2(t) - d_2}) \\
				&\vdots \\
				\dot{x}_n(t) &= V_n(1-e^{-\frac{\lambda_n}{V_n}(x_{n-1}(t) - x_n(t) - d_n})
			\end{array}
			\right.
		\end{align*}
		\newline
		And so, the position of each vehicle is:
		\begin{align*}
			\left\{
			\begin{array}{ll}
				x_1(t + \Delta t) &= x_1(t) + \Delta t   V_1\\
				x_2(t + \Delta t) &= x_2(t) + \Delta t  V_2(1-e^{-\frac{\lambda_2}{V_2}(x_{1}(t) - x_2(t) - d_2}) \\
				&\vdots \\
				x_n(t + \Delta t) &= x_n(t) + \Delta t  V_n(1-e^{-\frac{\lambda_n}{V_n}(x_{n-1}(t) - x_n(t) - d_n})
			\end{array}
			\right.
		\end{align*}
		\textbf{\underline{Implementation:}} \newline\newline
		
		for $\dot{x_1}$, we use the same algorithm than for the Linear model., However, to calculate the $\dot{x_i}$ values we use the following algorithm.
		
		\begin{algorithm}[H]
			\caption{$\dot{x_i}$}\label{alg:xi_dot}
			\begin{algorithmic}
				\State \textbf{Input:} \\
				\begin{itemize}
					\State $t:=\text{"time  step"}$
					\State$x_i:=\text{Table of position for the (i)th Car}$
					\State$x_{i-1}:=\text{Table of position for the (i-1)th Car}$
					\State$d_{i}:=\text{Safe following distance the (i)th Car}$
				\end{itemize}
				\State \textbf{Output:} \\
				\begin{itemize}[]
					\item $\dot{x_i}:=V_i$
				\end{itemize}
				\State \textbf{Algorithm:} \\
				\begin{itemize}[]
					\State $\dot{x_i}(t):=V_i(1-e^{-\frac{\lambda_i}{V_i}(x_{i-1}(t) - x_i(t) - d_i})$ 
					\State \Return $\dot{x_i}$ 
				\end{itemize}		
			\end{algorithmic}
		\end{algorithm}
		This algorithm determines the derivative of $x_i$ with respect to time, $\dot{x_i}$, based on the positions of the $i$th and $(i-1)$th cars, the safe following distance $d_i$, and the time step $t$. The result represents the velocity $V_i$ of the $i$th car.
		\subsection{Partial Differential Equations}
		
		\subsubsection{Euler Explicit}
		
		\textbf{\underline{Mathematical Theory:}} \newline\newline
		
		In the second part, the objective was to simulate the phenomenon of car traffic as a fluid. It means that instead of studying each car independently of the others, we focus on analyzing the density of the cars. To conduct this study, we need to employ a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) model.
		
		The PDE model used is the LWR  (Lighthill-Whitham-Richards) equation system. This system allows us to simulate car traffic using more or less complex equations For further insights on this topic, explore how uncertainty in the LWR traffic model's fundamental diagram affects prediction reliability, showcasing increased location uncertainty over time while accurately predicting disturbance magnitude. \cite{article}. The equation is defined exactly as follows:
		
		\begin{align*}
			\boxed{\partial_t\rho + \partial_xF(\rho)=0}
		\end{align*}
		
		\textbf{Where:}
		\begin{align*}
			& \rho(x,t) \text{ represents the traffic density at position } x \text{ and time } t. \\
			& F(\rho) \text{ denotes the traffic flux as a function of density.} \\
			& F(\rho) \text{ is often represented by a function modeling the relationship between traffic density and traffic velocity.} \\
			& F(\rho) = V(\rho) \cdot \rho \text{, where } V(\rho) \text{ is the traffic velocity as a function of density.}
		\end{align*}
		
		For the study, we choose two types of equations for LWR:
		\begin{align}
			\partial_t\rho + \partial_x\left[ \rho\left( 1-\frac{\rho}{\rho_{\text{max}}}\right) \cdot V_{\text{max}}\right] = 0 
		\end{align}
		Also known as the Free Flow model, it's a model that allows the simulation of systems with lower density.
		
		
		
		The first step to doing some simulation was to define a numerical model to calculate the appoximation of the solution.
		We choose the mzthod the most usual. Euler excplit method.
		So for the Free Flow model, the shem is given by : 
		\begin{align*}
			\boxed{\rho_{i}^{n+1} = \rho_i^n - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \cdot \left(\rho_i^n \cdot v_i^n - \rho_{i-1}^n \cdot v_{i-1}^n \right)
				=0}
		\end{align*}
		\textbf{\underline{Where : }}
		\begin{align*}
			\boxed{v_i^n = \left( 1 - \frac{\rho_i^n}{\rho_{max}}\right)  \times V_{max}}
		\end{align*}
		\newpage
		The approach for calculating density involves creating a matrix where each row represents a time step and each column represents a spatial point. Initially, this matrix is populated with zeros, except for the first row, which holds the initial conditions.
		
		This matrix structure appears as follows:
		
		\begin{align*}
			\bordermatrix { 
				& \Delta_x & 2\cdot \Delta_x & \hdots & L \cr 
				\Delta_t & \rho_1^1 & \rho_2^1 & \hdots & \rho_L^1 \cr \cr
				2\cdot \Delta_t & \rho_1^2 & \rho_2^2 & \hdots & \rho_L^2\cr
				\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \hdots & \vdots \cr
				T & \rho_1^T & \rho_2^T & \hdots & \rho_L^T}
		\end{align*}
		

		Initially, the matrix is filled with zeros except for the first row, which contains the initial density conditions:

		\begin{align*}
			\bordermatrix { 
				& \Delta_x & 2\cdot \Delta_x & \hdots & L \cr 
				\Delta_t & u_{0_{(\Delta_x)}} & u_{0_{(2 \cdot \Delta_x)}} & \hdots & u_{0_{(L)}} \cr 
				2\cdot \Delta_t & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\cr
				0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \cr
				T & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0}
		\end{align*}

		 
	
		Subsequent values in the matrix are calculated based on the previous values using the formula:
		
		\[
		\rho_{i}^{n+1} = \rho_i^n - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \cdot \left(\rho_i^n \cdot v_i^n - \rho_{i-1}^n \cdot v_{i-1}^n \right) = 0

		\subsubsection{Accordion Phenomenon}
		
		For this parts, we make the following assumptions:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The first car maintains a constant speed over time.
			\item The second car reaction is based on the behavior of the first one.
			\item The acceleration of the second car is governed by a constant function, denoted as alpha, which remains fixed. In the algorithm \ref{alg:xi_dot} we took $\alpha_2=2.0$
		\end{itemize} 
		
		\textbf{\underline{Simulation with the Linear Model For Two cars}} \newline\newline
		The initial simulation we aimed to conduct was intended to demonstrate and illustrate the behavior of drivers in real-life scenarios. Figure \ref{fig:Aco1} accurately depicts this phenomenon. Specifically, we 
		
		Similar to real-life situations, we observe that if the second car is too far behind the first one, it decelerates. Conversely, when it is adequately distant from the first car, it increases its speed.

		Similar to the previous case, applying Newell's method yields identical results. As depicted in Figure \ref{fig:1W2_ACCORD}, the graph illustrates the accordion phenomenon, featuring distinct periods of acceleration followed by deceleration.

		\subsubsection{Accident Phenomenon For The Linear Model }
		
		\textbf{\underline{Simulation with the Linear Model For Two cars}} \newline\newline
		
		For this case, the objectif is to show that if one driver have a bigger time reaction capacity, there is an accident.
		Onto this case, we took the same assumptions than before, but with a capacity of accelleration a little bit lower and a highter time reaction. In the algorithm \ref{alg:xi_dot} we took $\alpha_2=1.75$ and in the algorithm \ref{alg:update_positions} we took $h=1.5$
		
		On the figure \ref{fig:Acc1} accident is confirmed because there is a curve intersection (the position of the car number two (orange) is greater than the first car (blue)) So it means that the second car is crashed into the first car.

		In the three subsequent figures \ref{fig:1W2_ACC_1}, \ref{fig:1W2_ACC_2}, and \ref{fig:1W2_ACC_3}, we can observe a similar graph pattern to that of the linear model. However, in this scenario, we have the flexibility to vary additional parameters, such as the maximum speed of the cars (for instance, introducing a new car with a more powerful motor) and the safety distance, which is an inherent aspect of the Newell model. This variation allows us to witness accidents occurring at each curve intersection on the graph.

		\subsection{Study of Equilibrium, Stability, and Instability of the Solution}
		\subsubsection{System Stability and Equilibrium for the Linear Model}
		In this section, the goal is to investigate the difference in distance between two cars to determine the stability of solutions and ascertain whether an equilibrium exists.
		
		To achieve this, we analyze the solutions of the following system of equations:
		\begin{align*}
			\begin{cases}
				\dot{d_1} &= V_1 - \alpha_2 \cdot d_1 \\
				&\vdots \\
				\dot{d_n} &= \alpha_n \cdot d_{n-1} - \alpha_{n+1} \cdot d_n
			\end{cases}
		\end{align*}
		
		In our context, two cars constitute a 1D system, whereas with 3 cars, we encounter a 2D system of equations.
		
		Now, let's delve into the system's stability and equilibrium:
		
		\textbf{\underline{With 2 Cars}}:
		
		The equation of interest for analysis is:
		\begin{align*}
			\dot{d_1} &= V_1 - \alpha_2 \cdot d_1
		\end{align*}
		
		Upon solving (\ref{eq:EDO1}), we obtain the following equation for \(d_1(t)\):
		\begin{align*}
			\boxed{d_1(t) = \frac{{V_1 - V_1 \cdot e^{-\alpha_2(t-t_0)} + \alpha_2 \cdot d_1(t_0) \cdot e^{-\alpha_2(t-t_0)}}}{\alpha_2}}
		\end{align*}
		
		Initially, the intuition was that if \(\alpha_2 < 0\), the solution would diverge as one car moves backward and the other forward. However, upon studying the equation, we observe that the terms \(V_1\) and \(\alpha_2 \cdot d_1(t_0)\) are constant and less significant.
		
		Nevertheless, both terms, \(e^{-\alpha_2(t-t_0)}\), represent exponential functions of time. For negative \(\alpha_2\), these exponentials grow exponentially over time.
		
		Thus, the equation is stable and converges to the equilibrium \(\boxed{d_1(t)=\frac{V_1}{\alpha_2}}\) if \(\alpha_2 > 0\).
		
		Graphically, these observations are depicted in figures \ref{fig:RC1} and \ref{fig:RS1}. Notably, across all figures, there's no occurrence of solution explosion. Specifically, in figure \ref{fig:RC1}, the car's position exhibits periodic behavior concerning time. Meanwhile, in figure \ref{fig:RS1}, the depiction illustrates the convergence of the distance between two cars towards an equilibrium state.
		
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{RealisticCase.png}
			\caption[Realistic Case for the Linear Model with Two Cars]{\textbf{\underline{Realistic Case for the Linear Model with Two Cars: }}This simulation illustrates real-life behavior, characterized by a reaction time of approximately 1 second, achieved using a time step of 1 second instead of smaller increments in the algorithm.}
			\label{fig:RC1}
		\end{figure}
		
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{RealSolCase.png}
			\caption[Real Solution for the Linear Model with Two Cars]{\textbf{\underline{Real Solution for the Linear Model with Two Cars: }}This simulation depicts the accurate solution of the ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation), portraying an infinitesimally small reaction time through the use of smaller time increments in the algorithm, rather than representing real-life scenarios.}
			\label{fig:RS1}
		\end{figure}
		
		The subsequent part of our study aims to emphasize the impact of \(\alpha_2\) values on the stability of the system. For \(\alpha_2 > 0\), the distance between two cars converges, while for \(\alpha_2 < 0\), the ODE becomes unstable.
		
		To visualize this, Figure \ref{fig:AS1} showcases different analytical solutions of the ODE with \(\alpha_2\) values greater than 0. Conversely, Figure \ref{fig:AS2} displays analytical solutions for \(\alpha_2\) values lower than 0. These plots align with theoretical predictions, demonstrating stable solutions in Figure \ref{fig:AS1}, which converge to equilibrium, while unstable solutions are evident in Figure \ref{fig:AS2}.

			\label{fig:AS2}
		\end{figure}
		
		Finally, the last step was to show how the solution behaves. On Figure \ref{fig:FV1}, for a given acceleration greater than 0, the field of vectors converges onto the equilibrium. However, for negative acceleration, the field of vectors on Figure \ref{fig:FV2} diverges from the equilibrium.

			\label{fig:FV2}
		\end{figure}
		
		\textbf{\underline{With 3 cars}} : \newline\newline
		
		After the resolution (\ref{eq:EDO2}) we obtain the next equation for $d_1(t)$ and $d_2(t)$ : 
		
		\begin{align*}
			\begin{cases}
				d_1(t) &= \frac{C_1(\alpha_3-\alpha_2)}{\alpha_2e^{\alpha_2t}}+ \frac{V_1}{\alpha_2}\\
				d_2(t) &= \frac{C_1}{e^{\alpha_2t}} + \frac{C_2}{e^{\alpha_3 \cdot t}} + \frac{V_1}{\alpha_3}
			\end{cases}
		\end{align*}
		
		we set the initial condition to $d_1(0)=m, d_2(0)=n$ So we find easily $C_1$ and $C_2$ : 
		\begin{align*}
			&C_1=\frac{m\alpha_2-V_1}{\alpha_3-\alpha_2} \\
			&C_2=n-\frac{V_1}{\alpha_3} - C_1
		\end{align*}
		
		In the scenario involving just three cars, our analysis of the formula's terms leads us to a critical observation: divergence occurs if the value of $\alpha_2$ is less than zero. This finding confirms our initial intuition. This phenomenon is rooted in the constancy of equations over time and the unchanged hypotheses, allowing us to extend this analytical process to a scenario involving 'n' cars.
		
		The visual representation in Figure \ref{fig:SE1} elucidates the equilibrium dynamics. In the left subfigure, the vector field demonstrates convergence towards the equilibrium point. Simultaneously, the right subfigure presents the Analytical Solutions derived from the system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).

		\end{figure}
		
		Examining Figure \ref{fig:SE1}, it's evident that for positive acceleration, the vector field directs towards equilibrium. The distances between car 1 and 2, as well as between car 2 and 3, converge toward the equilibrium as indicated by the vector field.
		
		Contrarily, in Figure \ref{fig:SE2}, representing a scenario with negative acceleration, similar to the case of two cars, divergence is observed. Consequently, this divergence implies the absence of a feasible solution.

		Figure \ref{fig:SE2} visually portrays this divergence phenomenon. The left subfigure illustrates the vector field diverging from the theoretical equilibrium point. Meanwhile, the right subfigure showcases the Analytical Solutions derived from the set of ODEs, demonstrating a complete divergence leading to infinity. This divergence pattern is consistent with the negative acceleration scenario, echoing the lack of attainable solutions, akin to the three-car case.
		
		
	\subsubsection{System Stability and Equilibrium for the Newell's Model}
	
	\textbf{\underline{The Study of the equilibrium for two cars : }} \newline\newline
	
	
	The objective here, as before, is to study the stability of the model. The 1D equation is as follows:
	
	\begin{align*}
		&\dot{d_1}(t) = \dot{x_1}(t) - \dot{x_2}(t) = V_1 - V_2 + V_2 \cdot e^{-\frac{\alpha_2}{V_2}(d_1 - d_{2}^{sec})} = f(d_1, t), \\
		&\left\{
		\begin{aligned}
			V_1 &:= \text{Maximum speed for car number 1}, \\
			V_2 &:= \text{Maximum speed for car number 2}, \\
			\alpha_2 &:= \text{capacity of acceleration for car number 2}, \\
			d_{2}^{sec} &:= \text{security distance that car number 2 maintains}.
		\end{aligned}
		\right.
	\end{align*}
	
	Firstly, let's determine the equilibrium:
	
	\begin{align*}
		V_1 - V_2 + V_2 \cdot e^{-\frac{\alpha_2}{V_2}(d_1 - d_{2}^{sec})} &= 0 \\
		e^{-\frac{\alpha_2}{V_2}(d_1 - d_{2}^{sec})} &= \frac{V_2-V_1}{V_2} \\
		e^{-\frac{\alpha_2}{V_2}d_1} &= \frac{V_2-V_1}{V_2}e^{-\frac{\alpha_2}{V_2}d_2} \\
		-\frac{\lambda_2}{V_2}d_1 &= \ln \left(\frac{V_2-V_1}{V_2}e^{-\frac{\alpha_2}{V_2}d_2} \right) \\
		d_1^* &= -\frac{V_2}{\lambda_2}\ln \left(\frac{V_2-V_1}{V_2}e^{-\frac{\alpha_2}{V_2}d_2} \right)
	\end{align*}
	
	The challenge with this equation is the inability to find an analytical solution. Consequently, we apply Lyapunov's Indirect Theorem to investigate the equilibrium.
	
	In the context of 1D analysis, we begin by calculating $f'(d_1, t)$, which results in:
	
	\[
	f'(d_1, t) = -\alpha_2e^{-\frac{\alpha_2}{V_2}(d_1 - d_{2}^{sec})}
	\]
	
	It is evident that $f'(d_1, t)$ is negative for all values of $\alpha_2$ greater than zero. Therefore, in our specific scenario, the equilibrium remains stable at all times, as negative acceleration is not considered.
	
	From the equilibrium, we also observe that the equilibrium exists if and only if $V_2 > V_1$.
	
	Clearly, the condition for a stable equilibrium is $\alpha_2 > 0$ and $V_2 > V_1$.

		\label{fig:SE3}
	\end{figure}
	
		Graphically, this can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:SE3}. On the left side of the figure, the phenomenon of convergence towards equilibrium can be demonstrated when the previously performed conditions are adhered to.
	
	On the right side, we depict the solutions of the system using Newell's equation. It is noticeable that over time, the distance between the two cars gradually increase at the beginning of the simulation, eventually approaching a constant value, which aligns with the equilibrium observed in the left figure.
	
	\textbf{\underline{The Study of the equilibrium for three cars : }} \newline\newline
	
	\begin{align*}
		&\begin{cases}
			\begin{aligned}
				&\dot{d_1}(t) = \dot{x_1}(t) - \dot{x_2}(t) = V_1 - V_2 + V_2 \cdot e^{-\frac{\alpha_2}{V_2}(d_1 - d_{2}^{sec})} = f(d_1, t), \\
				&\dot{d_2}(t) = \dot{x_2}(t)-\dot{x_3}(t) = V_2 - V_2 \cdot e^{-\frac{\alpha_2}{V_2}(d_1 - d_{2}^{sec})} - V_3 + V_3 \cdot e^{-\frac{\alpha_3}{V_3}(d_2 - d_{3}^{sec})}
			\end{aligned}
		\end{cases}
		 \\
		&\left\{
		\begin{aligned}
			V_1 &:= \text{Maximum speed for car number 1}, \\
			V_2 &:= \text{Maximum speed for car number 2}, \\
			\alpha_2 &:= \text{capacity of acceleration for car number 2}, \\
			d_{2}^{sec} &:= \text{security distance that car number 2 maintains}.
		\end{aligned}
		\right.
	\end{align*}
	
	again, we apply Lyapunov's Indirect Theorem to investigate the equilibrium.
	
	
	We are going to calculkate the Jacobienne matrix : 
	
	\begin{align*}
		J_{\bar{x}}=\begin{pmatrix}
			-\alpha_2e^{-\frac{\alpha_2}{V_2}(d_1 - d_{2}^{sec})} & 0 & \\
			\alpha_2e^{-\frac{\alpha_2}{V_2}(d_1 - d_{2}^{sec})} & -\alpha_3e^{-\frac{\alpha_3}{V_3}(d_2 - d_{3}^{sec})} &
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{align*}
	
	However, in the 2D case, Lyapunov tells us that the equilibrium is stable if:
	
	\[
	\boxed{
		\begin{aligned}
			Tr(J_{\bar{x}}) &< 0 \\
			\det(J_{\bar{x}}) &> 0
		\end{aligned}
	}
	\]

	The both condition are respected iff $\lambda_2>0, \lambda_3>0$
	 \newline\newline
	 
	In the case of two cars, if the conditions are respected, we can observe graphically the convergence towards the equilibrium point. As the equations apply uniformly to all cars, the equilibrium exists under the same conditions, even for the n-th car.
	
	On the Figure \ref{fig:SE4}, the equilibrium point is represented by the coordinates corresponding to the equilibrium distance on the y-axis between car 2 and 3, and on the x-axis between car 1 and 2 on the figure \ref{fig:SE5}. This distance, similar to other cases, can be found on the figure \ref{fig:SE5} by calculating the difference between the positions of the cars.
	
	Similar to the previous scenario, the plotted solution is not the actual solution but an approximation using the Euler Explicit method because obtaining an analytical solution is impossible.

	\begin{align*} 
		\dot{d_1}(t) = V_1 - \alpha_2 \cdot d_1
	\end{align*}
	We use the variable separation method to Solve this EDO, so we obtain : 
	\begin{align*} 
		&\int_{x(t_0)}^{x(t_f)} \frac{1}{V_1 - \alpha_2 \cdot d_1(t)} d \ d_1(t) = \int_{t_0}^{t_f} dt \\
		&-\frac{1}{\lambda_2} \left[ \ln\left| V_1 - \alpha_2 \cdot d_1(t) \right| \right]_{x(t_0)}^{x(t_f)} = t_f-t_0 \\

	\end{align*}
	We could remove the |.| because the sign is always the same. And we get : 
	
	\begin{align*}
		&\ln\left( \frac{V_1 - \alpha_2 \cdot d_1(t_f)}{V_1 - \alpha_2 \cdot d_1(t_0)} \right)  = -\lambda_2( t_f-t_0)\\
		&\frac{V_1 - \alpha_2 \cdot d_1(t_f)}{V_1 - \alpha_2 \cdot d_1(t_0)}  = e^{-\lambda_2( t_f-t_0)} \\
		&V_1 - \alpha_2 \cdot d_1(t_f)   = (V_1 - \alpha_2 \cdot d_1(t_0))e^{-\lambda_2( t_f-t_0)} \\
		&\boxed{
			d_1(t) = \frac{V_1 - [V_1 - \alpha_2 \cdot d_1(t_0)]e^{-\lambda_2( t_f-t_0)}}{\alpha_2}

			\alpha_2 & -\alpha_3

			d_1 \\
			d_2
		\end{pmatrix} + 
		\begin{pmatrix}
			V_1 \\
			0
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{align*}
	
	The first step is to perfom the eigenvectors of the matrix:
	
	\begin{align*}
		\begin{vmatrix}
			X+\alpha_2 & 0 \\
			\alpha_2 & X+\alpha_3
		\end{vmatrix} = (X+\alpha_2)(X+\alpha_3=X^2+X(\alpha_3+\alpha_2)+\alpha_2\alpha_3
	\end{align*}
	by simple resolution of the second order polynomial, we could fin two eigenvalues: \newline
	$\lambda_1=-\alpha_2, \lambda_2 = -\alpha_3$
	we looking for the two eigen vectors : 
	
	\[
	\begin{cases}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			0 & 0 & | & 0 \\
			\alpha_2 & -\alpha_3 + \alpha_2 & | & 0
		\end{bmatrix} \\ \\
		\begin{bmatrix}
			-\alpha_2 + \alpha_3 & 0 & | & 0 \\
			\alpha_2 & 0 & | & 0
		\end{bmatrix}
	\end{cases}
	\]
	
	It is easy to see that the two following vector are vector that verify the condition : 
	
	\[
	\begin{cases}
		u_1=\begin{pmatrix}
			1 \\
			\frac{\alpha_3-\alpha_2}{\alpha_2}
		\end{pmatrix} \\ \\
		u_2=\begin{pmatrix}
			0 \\
			1
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{cases}
	\]
	
	Then, we know that a general solution of the equation is : 
	\begin{align*}
		&\bar{D}
		(t) = \sum_{i=1}^2 X_i \\
		&\text{where } X_i = C_i e^{\lambda_it} u_i, \\
		&\text{with } C_i \text{ being constants to be determined, and } u_i \text{ as the eigenvectors}, \textbf{and} \lambda_i \textbf{the eigenvalues}.
	\end{align*}
	
	So : 
	\begin{align*}
		X_1=\begin{pmatrix}
			\frac{C_1(\alpha_3-\alpha_2)}{\alpha_2e^{\alpha_2t}} \\ \\
			\frac{C_1}{e^{\alpha_2t}}
		\end{pmatrix} \\ \\ 
		X_2=\begin{pmatrix}
			0 \\
			\frac{C_2}{e^{\alpha_3 \cdot t}}
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{align*}
	
	Finally the general solution is given by : 
	
	\begin{align*}
		\bar{X}
		=\begin{pmatrix}
			\frac{C_1(\alpha_3-\alpha_2)}{\alpha_2e^{\alpha_2t}} \\ \\
			\frac{C_1}{e^{\alpha_2t}} + \frac{C_2}{e^{\alpha_3 \cdot t}}
		\end{pmatrix} \\ \\ 
	\end{align*}
	
	Then we are going to find for particular solution : 
	
	
	\begin{align*}
		\begin{cases}
			\dot{d_1} &= 0 \\
			\dot{d_2} &= 0
		\end{cases} \iff 
		\begin{cases}
			d_1^* &= \frac{V_1}{\alpha_2} \\
			d_2^* &= \frac{V_1}{\alpha_3}
		\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
	
	In clear, we have : 
	\begin{align*}
		\begin{cases}
			d_1(t) &= \frac{C_1(\alpha_3-\alpha_2)}{\alpha_2e^{\alpha_2t}}+ \frac{V_1}{\alpha_2}\\
			d_2(t) &= \frac{C_1}{e^{\alpha_2t}} + \frac{C_2}{e^{\alpha_3 \cdot t}} + \frac{V_1}{\alpha_3}
		\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
	
	we set the initial condition to \newline 
	$d_1(0)=m, d_2(0)=n$ So we find easily $C_1 and C_2$ : 
	\begin{align*}
		&C_1=\frac{m\alpha_2-V_1}{\alpha_3-\alpha_2} \\
		&C_2=n-\frac{V_1}{\alpha_3} - C_1
	\end{align*}
