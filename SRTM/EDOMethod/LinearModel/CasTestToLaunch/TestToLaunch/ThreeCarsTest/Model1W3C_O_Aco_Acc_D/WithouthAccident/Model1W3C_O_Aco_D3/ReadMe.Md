Simple model with 3 cars to simulate the accordeon aspect on the road:
-into this case, the first drivers is already at the same speed 130km/h exept if there is an obstacle it slow down
-the second stop the cceleration if the critical distance is to small and then incresse the speed constant
-the last one drivers is drunk so we want to see what is the traffic behavior.

the parameters are : 
-h=1.0
-a2=1.0
-a3=1.0
- Amplitude of the perturbation : 0.9
- Angular frequency : 2.0
- Phase : pi/4
