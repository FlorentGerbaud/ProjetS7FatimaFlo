**Two cases:**

As we could have anticipated before the simulation, the solution for the distance between the two cars is stable if the acceleration is positive, because if the acceleration is negative, the car moves backward, and the distance between the two cars increases.

So, there are two cases:
- If Î± < 0, then the solution is not stable.
- Otherwise, the solution is stable.
