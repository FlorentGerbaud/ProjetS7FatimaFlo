**Objective:**

The objective is to show the two cases we have:

1. Firstly, if we look at the `RealisticCase.png`, we can observe the behavior of the car in real life with drivers braking, accelerating, and so on. However, on this graph, the distance varies continuously.

2. On the second figure, `RealSolCase.png`, we have the real solution for x1(t) and x2(t). However, it does not represent real life accurately due to the fact that the time step (h) is too small (h also represents the reaction time for the driver). Nonetheless, on this figure, we can identify the equilibrium for the distance.

**Parameters:**

For `Realistic`:
- h = 1.0
- a2 = 2.0

For `RealSol`:
- h = 0.001
- a2 = 2.0
