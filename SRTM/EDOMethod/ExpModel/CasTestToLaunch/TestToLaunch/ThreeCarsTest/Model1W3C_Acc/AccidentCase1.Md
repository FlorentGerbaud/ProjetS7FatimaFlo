# Simple Model with 3 Cars for Simulating an Accident

In this simulation, we model an accident between car 2 and car 3 on the road. The scenario involves setting an acceleration that is too significant, leading to a collision between cars 1 and 2.

## Parameters:

- `lambda2`: 15.0
- `h`: 1.0
- `d2`: 1.0
- `nameCase`: "Simulation of the Accordion Phenomenon"
- `lambda3`: 5.0
- `d3`: 2.0
